# Student Information System (Java)

##  Project Overview
The **Student Information System** is a console-based Java application designed to manage student records efficiently.  
It provides a **menu-driven interface** that allows users to perform operations such as adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and searching student information including **Student ID, Name, Age, Grade, and Contact Details**.

This project is developed to strengthen **Java fundamentals**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, and practical usage of **collections and validation**.

---

##  Objectives
- Understand core Java programming concepts
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Perform CRUD operations using `ArrayList`
- Implement basic input validation and error handling
- Build confidence in console-based Java applications

---

##  Technologies & Tools Used
- **Java (JDK 8 or above)**
- **Spring Tool Suite (STS)**
- **GitHub**
- **GitHub Desktop**
- **Google Docs** (for documentation)
- **Scanner Class** (for user input)

---

##  Features
- Add new student details
- View all student records with formatted output
- Update existing student information
- Delete student records
- Search students by Student ID or Name
- Validate age (positive number)
- Validate grade (valid range)
- Menu-driven console interface
- Basic error handling for invalid inputs
